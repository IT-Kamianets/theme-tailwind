# IT Kamianets Website Tailwind Theme

Official Angular theme template for public-facing projects inside the IT Kamianets GitHub organization.

This repository serves as a standardized foundation for landing pages, informational websites, and community platforms. It ensures consistent styling, domain configuration, structure, and contribution workflow across all projects.

# 🌐 Domain Configuration (CNAME)

This repository includes a `CNAME` file for GitHub Pages deployment.

When using this template:

1. Open the `CNAME` file
2. Replace the domain with the new project domain

Example:

```
voltlab.itkamianets.com
```

If not updated, GitHub Pages will continue pointing to the previous project domain.

Always verify:

- Repository → Settings → Pages
- Custom domain matches `CNAME`
- SSL is enabled

All contributors must strictly follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

This applies to:

- Developers
- External contributors
- AI tools

Core principles:

- Use Conventional Commits
- One logical change per commit
- Proper branch naming
- No direct commits to `master`
- PR must reference an issue

Before starting work:

1. Create a branch
2. Follow naming convention
3. Link GitHub issue
4. Keep commits clean and focused

---

# 🤖 AI Usage Policy

When using AI tools:

- Always provide `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Enforce commit format
- Enforce branch naming rules
- Review generated code manually
- Do not allow uncontrolled structural changes

AI assists development — it does not define architecture.

---

# 🚀 Deployment

Deployment is managed via:

- GitHub Pages
- `CNAME` domain configuration
- Optional GitHub Actions workflow

After pushing to `master`:

- Verify Pages build status
- Confirm correct domain resolution
- Check SSL certificate
