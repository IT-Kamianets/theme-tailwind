### Contributing rules

- Use **Conventional Commits**: `type(scope): subject`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `docs`, `style`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `revert`
- Subject: **imperative**, present tense, **no period**, keep it short
- One commit = **one logical change** (split big work into smaller commits)
- Prefix private class variables with an underscore (e.g. \_cache, \_token, \_state) to clearly mark internal usage and avoid accidental external access.
- In Angular templates, if the same expression (signal read, computed, or method call) is used more than once, assign it with `@let` and reuse the variable instead of calling it repeatedly. Use inline expression only when it appears once.
- Use Tailwind via BEM + @apply in component scss; keep templates readable (no long utility strings in HTML).
- Avoid hover effects that change layout (border/size/padding). Prefer non-layout effects (background tint, shadow) and always add matching :focus-visible styles.
- Keep spacing and colors consistent (use Tailwind scale + existing design tokens; avoid ad-hoc pixel values unless unavoidable).
- Document only public functions and variables with short, clear comments directly above their declarations (purpose + expected behavior).
